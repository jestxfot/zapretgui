Built-in preset templates

Where to put files
  - runtime (Windows): %APPDATA%\zapret\presets\_builtin\*.txt
  - repo (for packaging via Inno Setup): preset_zapret2/builtin_presets/*.txt

Rules
  - File name becomes preset name (without .txt)
  - Names starting with '_' are ignored (useful for templates/examples)
  - UTF-8 text

Format
  - Same as a normal preset file.
  - '# Preset:' / '# ActivePreset:' header is optional; if present, it will be normalized to the file name.
  - Must contain at least one '--lua-init=' line and at least one '--filter-' line, otherwise it may be skipped.

Notes
  - Built-in presets are virtual and loaded from %APPDATA%\zapret\presets\_builtin.
  - When a user edits a built-in preset in UI, the app creates a user copy: '<Name> (копия)'.
