Drop built-in preset templates here as "*.txt".

Rules:
- File name (without extension) becomes the preset name in UI.
- Do not use leading underscores ("_...") for real presets.
- The app will auto-create missing built-in presets in the user presets folder.

Example:
  preset_zapret2/builtin_presets/My Preset.txt  -> built-in preset name: "My Preset"
